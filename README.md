# KATAS
## Introduction
This project hold a collection of Kata that I implemented for training and fun. In each Kata there are links to the rules of the exercise.

## StringCalculator
The purpose of this Kata is to create a calculator that can add numbers from an input string. Rules are explained in the project or they are available [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c741968bfba3e13975e33a6/t/5ca6614d971a1877cadc4f8a/1554407757512/String+Calculator+Kata+v1.pdf). In this project I used a TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach.
